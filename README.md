Source of a cool bot that I managed to make with [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js). 
This bot's status cycles trough the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Stellar. You can buy and sell crypto!!! LESGOOO buy Bitcoin to the MOON

# FEATURES
- Buy and sell over 1000 cryptocurrencies with USD
- Send USD to other users
- Get real-time price data and visual price chart
- Price_as_bot_status(Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Stellar);
- DM price alerts

And the best thing is that all this is FREE!

This bot gives users the ability to check the current price of over 1000 different cryptocurrencies. The visual chart is not very consistent so the chart may not be given for every request.

### COMMAND LIST:
This bot uses only application commands!
```
/price [coin]             //Get current price

```
### Mine command explained:
To get a new math question only type ```/mine``` without the [answer] argument it will then give you a simple math question. To answer that question type ```/mine [answer]``` and define the [answer]. If the answer was right you will receive USD reward.
